About Grantlee
--------------

Grantlee is a plugin based String Template system written using the Qt framework.
The goals of the project are to make it easier for application developers to 
separate the structure of documents from the data they contain, opening the door
for theming.

The syntax is intended to follow the syntax of the Django template system, and 
the design of Django is reused in Grantlee. Django is covered by a BSD style license.

Part of the design of both is that application developers can extend the syntax by
implementing their own tags and filters. For details of how to do that, see the API
documentation.

For template authors, different applications using Grantlee will present the same 
interface and core syntax for creating new themes. For details of how to write 
templates, see the documentation.
