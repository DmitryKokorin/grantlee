About Grantlee
--------------

Grantlee is a plugin based String Template system written using the Qt framework.
The goals of the project are to make it easier for application developers to 
separate the structure of documents from the data they contain, opening the door
for theming.

The syntax is intended to follow the syntax of the Django template system, and 
the design of Django is reused in Grantlee. Django is covered by a BSD style license.

Part of the design of both is that application developers can extend the syntax by
implementing their own tags and filters. For details of how to do that, see the API
documentation.

For template authors, different applications using Grantlee will present the same 
interface and core syntax for creating new themes. For details of how to write 
templates, see the documentation.

The Grantlee distribution contains several components.

* grantlee_core_library contains the code for parsing and interpreting template 
    syntax, as well as interfaces for extending the syntax using plugins.
* grantlee_loadertags contains the library of tags used to perform template 
    inclusion, and inheritance.
* grantlee_defaulttags contains the library of tags made available by default to
    all templates. These tags include for example 'for', 'if', 'ifequal' etc.
* grantlee_defaultfilters contains the library of filters made available by default
    to all templates. These filters include for example 'upper', 'lower', 'cut' etc.
* tests contains the unit tests for Grantlee.
* scripts contains convenience scripts for creating release tarballs, generating #
    documentation, creating translation files etc.
